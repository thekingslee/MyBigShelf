# 📚 MyBigShelf

**BigShelf** is a dropshipping online bookstore designed to make books more accessible to readers across Nigeria, and help them actually finish the books they buy. This repo contains the codebase for the BigShelf website, built with performance, clarity, and mobile-first design in mind.

# 🎯 Big Philosophy

> ✨ At BigShelf, we believe a book’s real value comes from finishing it — not just buying it.

BigShelf is more than an e-commerce site. It’s a movement to help people get real value from their books that is why we build tools to help users go from buying a book to actually getting something out of it.
